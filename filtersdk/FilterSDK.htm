<p>AviSynth external Filter SDK is a package for developers to create your own filters (plugins) for AviSynth.</p>

<p>The package consists of:

<ul>
<li> this documentation files in HTML format;</li>
<li> the header file 'avisynth.h' (recent version) with all declarations to include in plugin source code;</li>
<li> SimpleSample plugin source codes;</li>
<li> may be some extra files in 'Extra' folder.</li>
</ul> 

<p>You must have some <a href="SDKNecessaries.htm">necessary software.</a></p>

<p><a href="BensAviSynthDocs.htm">Bens AviSynth Docs</a> is the documentation written for AviSynth 1.0 by Ben Rudiak-Gould, in its original form.</p>


<p>See more about the modifications for AviSynth 2.5 in the <a href="AviSynthTwoFiveSDK.htm">AviSynth Two-Five SDK</a>.</p>


<p>Also, <a href="SimpleSample.htm">Simple Sample</a> has some very simple examples 
covering development of a filter that does virtually nothing through to one 
that draws a variable sized square, in the middle of the screen, 
in all <a href="ColorSpaces.htm">Color Spaces</a>.</p>


<p>One thing not covered in SimpleSample, 
is how to <a href="ChangeFrameSize.htm">Change Frame Size</a> in a filter.</p>

<p>Also have a look at <a href="GettingStartedWithAudio.htm">Getting started with Audio</a>.</p>

<p>There are several different Colorspaces in AviSynth. 
See more information about <a href="ColorSpaces.htm">Color Spaces</a> and 
<a href="WorkingWithImages.htm">Working With Images</a>.</p>


<p>Read more about the <a href="InternalFunctions.htm">Internal Functions</a> in AviSynth.</p>


<p>You can also browse various topic on <a href="AssemblerOptimizing.htm">Assembler Optimizing</a>.</p>


<p>Once you've got the basics down on AVS development (Ben's text is quite good), 
the <a href="http://virtualdub.org/filtersdk">[SDK]</a> for VirtualDub is also a good read.  
Good news is you won't have to worry about writing <a href="http://function-pointer.org/">[function pointers]</a> 
and <a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/pw5/index.html">[raw Win32]</a>; 
meanwhile, Avery knows his stuff when it comes to video &amp; CPU optimization techniques, 
so you best pay attention.</p>

<p>Some video related ebooks (PDF) can be downloaded freely from <a href="http://www.snellwilcox.com/reference.html">[Snell &amp; Wilcox]</a>.</p>

<p>Please read AviSynth <a href="SDKLicense.htm">FilterSDK license</a> and <a href="SDKHistory.htm">SDK History.</a></p>

<p>And welcome to <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/forumdisplay.php?s=&f=69">[AviSynth Development forum]</a>!</p>
