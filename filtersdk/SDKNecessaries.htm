<p>What is necessary to create an AviSynth plugin?</p>

<h4>You must have some compatible development tool:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft Visual C/C++ 6, 7, 7.1, or 8</li>
<li>Microsoft Visual C++ Toolkit 2003 (free, try search vctoolkitsetup.exe) with some IDE (e.g. free <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org">CodeBlocks</a>)</li>
<li>Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express edition (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/default.aspx">free download</a>)</li>
<li>Intel ICL Compiler v7 (?) or above</li>
</ul>

<h4>You also need in Microsoft Platform SDK (if it is not included with compiler).</h4>
<p>Free download it from <a href=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=EBA0128F-A770-45F1-86F3-7AB010B398A3&displaylang=en>Microsoft site</a>. 
The last SDK that will work with VC 6.0 was the February 2003 Edition.
</p>

<h4>For some very special plugins (GPU) you may need in DirectX SDK.</h4>

<h4>Finally, you must include small header file 'avisynth.h'.</h4> 
<p>You can get it with this FilterSDK, download with AviSynth source code, or take from some plugin source package. 
There are several versions of this header file from various AviSynth versions.
<p>Header file avisynth.h from v1.0.x to v2.0.x have <code>AVISYNTH_INTERFACE_VERSION = 1.</code> 
Plugins compliled with them will be not (natively) compatible with AviSynth 2.5.x.</p>
<p>Header file avisynth.h from v2.5.0 to v2.5.5 have <code>AVISYNTH_INTERFACE_VERSION = 2.</code>
Plugins compliled with them will (generally) work in AviSynth v2.5.0 to v2.5.7 (and above).
But avisynth.h files from versions v2.5.0 - v2.5.5 (and betas) are not identical.  
We recommend to use avisynth.h from versions 2.5.5 or later.
Previous versions of avisynth.h are obsolete and have some bugs.
<p>Header files avisynth.h from v2.5.6 and v2.5.7 are almost identical and have <code>AVISYNTH_INTERFACE_VERSION = 3.</code>
Plugins compliled with them will work in v2.5.6, v2.5.7. They will also work in v2.5.5 and below, 
if you do not use new interface features and do not call <code>env->CheckVersion</code> function.
<p>New beeing developed AviSynth version 2.6.x will use new header avisynth.h probably with <code>AVISYNTH_INTERFACE_VERSION = 4.</code> 
Plugins complied with AviSynth v2.5.x header will work in AviSynth 2.6.x too,
but plugins compliled with new AviSynth v2.6.x header will probably not work in AviSynth v2.5.x.</p>
<p>Generally good start is to take some similar plugin source code as a draft for improving or own development.
Attention: there are many old plugins source code packages with older avisynth.h included.
(for example, SimpleSample zip file contains avisynth.h file from from AviSynth v2.5.4). Simply replace it by new one.

<h4>Plugin CPP source code must be compiled as Win32 DLL (multi-threaded or multi-threaded DLL) without MFC.</h4>

<p>Of course, use Release build with optimization. Typical compiler switches are /MT /O2 and /dll /nologo for linker </p> 

<p>See <a href="CompilingAvisynthPlugins.htm">step by step instructions.</a></p>

<p>You can NOT use other compiler like GNU C++ to create regular AviSynth plugins.
You may also try to use some tools (GNU C++, Visual Basic, Delphi) 
to create so called AviSynth C plugins with <a href="http://kevin.atkinson.dhs.org/avisynth_c/">AviSynth C API</a> 
(but it is not mainsteam).
