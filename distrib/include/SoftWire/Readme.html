	<P><U><STRONG>Summary</STRONG></U></P>
	<P>SoftWire is a class library written in object-oriented C++ for compiling 
		assembly code. It can be used in projects to generate x86 machine code at 
		run-time as an alternative to self-modifying code. Scripting languages might 
		also benefit by using SoftWire as a JIT-compiler back-end. It also allows to 
		eliminate jumps for variables which are temporarily constant during run-time, 
		like for efficient graphics processing by constructing an optimised pipeline. 
		Because of its possibility for 'instruction rewiring' by run-time conditional 
		compilation, I named it "SoftWire". It is targeted only at developers with a 
		good knowledge of C++ and x86 assembly.</P>
	<P>This document applies to SoftWire 4.0.1 and newer versions.</P>

	<P><U><STRONG>1. Demo</STRONG></U></P>
	<P>The demo application assembles seven test routines: HelloWorld.asm shows that it 
		is possible to call external functions, like printf. SetBits.asm is a function 
		to set a number of bits in a buffer, starting from a given bit. 
		CrossProduct.asm shows the use of floating-point instructions, macros and 
		inline functions. AlpahBlend.asm uses MMX instructions for blending 32-bit 
		colors, and conditionally compiles for Katmai compatible or older processors. 
		It also shows how to define static data. Factorial.asm calculates a factorial 
		by recursively calling itself. Mandelbrot.asm draws the Mandelbrot fractal in 
		ASCII. The last test shows the use of run-time intrinsics.</P>
	<P>Execute SoftWire.exe at your own risk! It has been tested on many systems, but I 
		make no guarantee that it will work on yours.</P>

	<P><U><STRONG>2. Compilation</STRONG></U></P>
	<P>
		This library was developed with Visual C++ .NET&nbsp;and has project and 
		workspace files for this compiler included. Solution files for Visual C++ 6.0 
		and makefiles for Dev-C++ and GCC are also included. For GCC you will need a 
		recent version which supports nameless structs. Should you have any problems 
		compiling the code, please mail me at <A href="mailto:nicolas@capens.net">nicolas@capens.net</A>.</P>
	<P>Compilation with GCC requires the -fno-operator-names option. This is needed to 
		avoid an error with functions named <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">and</FONT>,
		<FONT face="Courier New" size="2">not</FONT>, <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">or</FONT>
		and <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">xor</FONT>, which are according to the 
		C++ standard reserved keyword. For more information see the Run-Time Intrinsics 
		section.</P>
	<P><U><STRONG>3. Syntax</STRONG></U></P>
	<P>Before reading this detailed information it is best to take a look at Test.cpp 
		and the .asm files to see the basics of what SoftWire has to offer...</P>
	<P>The source line layout is similar to that from NASM and the Visual C++ inline 
		assembler:<BR>
		<FONT face="Courier New" size="2">label:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; instruction 
			operands&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; comment</FONT></P>
	<P>The assembler can accept a file with the .asm extension. This file is treated as 
		one block of code, but subroutines and data can be created with labels. 
		Execution will start at the lablel with the same name as the file, unless an 
		other entry point has been defined. The assembler generates only 32-bit code 
		for processors compatible with the 386 or above.</P>
	<P>C/C++ comments are also supported. The assembler is case-sensitive, except for 
		instructions and registers. Labels are like in inline assembler and cannot have 
		special characters like $, #, @, ~, ?, etc.</P>
	<P>Specifiers are always optional, but when the assembler has multiple possible 
		instructions you can't predict the behaviour without using a specifier. For 
		example, the assembler can't know if the code <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">fld 
			[esi]</FONT> uses single or double precision floating-point numbers without 
		a <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">DWORD</FONT> or <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			QWORD</FONT> specifier. The <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">PTR</FONT> keyword 
		is optional. The <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">NEAR</FONT> or <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			SHORT</FONT> keywords can be used for jumps or calls and are equivalent.</P>
	<P>The assembler supports the MMX, 3DNow!, Pentium Pro, SSE and SSE2 instruction 
		set. Some specific instructions have been removed because they are unsafe 
		and/or not useful for 32-bit protected mode:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI>
		Privileged instructions
		<LI>
		FAR calls and jumps
		<LI>
		Undocumented instructions
		<LI>
		Extended precision 80-bit FPU instructions
		<LI>
		State save/restore instructions
		<LI>
			Segment/debug/control/table registers</LI></UL>
	<P>This is very similar to the Visual C++ inline assembler. It should not limit you 
		for 'normal' use of this run-time assembler. For more details, take a look at 
		the InstructionSet.cpp file. You can always write your own machine-code by 
		defining it as static data.</P>
	<P>You can define static data with the <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">DB</FONT>, <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			DW</FONT> and <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">DD</FONT> keywords. By 
		using a label, the address of this data can be referenced. The data will be 
		created at the location of the definition, so it's advisable to put it after 
		the return or before the function label. Since there is no standard way to 
		declare local data, you should put everything on the stack yourself. Local data 
		is not that usefull for a run-time assembler anyway. You could use the 'cdecl' 
		calling convention (standard in Visual C++) to let the caller push the 
		arguments on the stack and remove them after the function has been called. 
		Subroutines can also be created by using labels. To create arrays of static 
		data, you can use <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">DB[#]</FONT>, <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			DW[#]</FONT> and <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">DD[#]</FONT>. All 
		variables will be aligned on their natural boundaries.</P>
	<P>To align data or code yourself, you can use the <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">ALIGN</FONT>
		keyword. For efficiency, jump labels should be 16 byte aligned, and for most 
		SSE instructions the data also has to be 16 byte aligned. The assembler will 
		use <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">NOP</FONT> instructions for padding for 
		both data and code alignment.</P>
	<P>External data can be declared by using the <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">Assembler::defineExternal</FONT>
		method in your C++ code. A handy macro defined in <EM>Assembler.hpp</EM> makes 
		it possible to export a function like printf with <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			ASM_EXPORT(printf)</FONT>. Externals can be any kind of data defined in 
		your C++ application, and are treated like void pointers. Externals should be 
		declared before assembling the file. They do not have to be re-declared in the 
		assembly code.</P>
	<P>For constants, only numbers and character constants are supported. They can be 
		in binary, octal, decimal or hexadecimal base, with the usual pre- or 
		postfixes. All constant expressions are evaluated, inclusing those of data 
		definitions and memory references. String literals can be created by using <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			DB</FONT> and double quotation marks.</P>
	<P>Conditional compilation can be controlled with the <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			#if</FONT>, <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">#elif</FONT>, <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			#else</FONT> and <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">#endif</FONT> precompiler 
		directives. The <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">ASM_DEFINE</FONT> macro can 
		be used to send an integer to the assembler which can be used after the <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			#if</FONT> and <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">#elif</FONT> directives. 
		Boolean expressions are evaluated as in C/C++.</P>
	<P>This powerful feature can be used to generate many different specific functions 
		without having to code completely new ones. It can eliminate jumps in the 
		assembly code to generate exactly the optmized function you need. An example of 
		this is an SIMD optimized vertex pipeline for 3D graphics. Without conditional 
		compilation, many comparisons and jumps would be needed per vertex to transform 
		and light it correctly for the current settings. With run-time conditional 
		compilation, these instructions can be eliminated, leaving only the wanted 
		instructions, while still being able to handle thousands of setting 
		combinations. It also allows to write different code for other processors, 
		without needing a control statement in your high-performance assembly code and 
		without the need to write it as separate functions which are difficult to 
		maintain.</P>
	<P>The preprocessor also supports <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">#include</FONT> 
		and <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">#define</FONT>. There is also an <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			inline</FONT> keyword, which behaves like <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">#define</FONT>
		but produces less error-prone code (caused by nested macros) and has a nicer 
		syntax for multiple lines:</P>
	<P><FONT face="Courier New" size="2">inline macroName(argument1, argument2, ...)<BR>
			{<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; code block<BR>
			}</FONT></P>
	<P>It is a nice way of defining new instructions, and it even allows to define 
		'instructions' to be emulated with x86 assembly, like DirectX shader 
		instructions! With normal macros, the only problem for doing this would be that 
		you need parenthesis around the arguments. But even this is solved with the 
		inline macros. You can simply use the above macro like this:</P>
	<PRE>macroName argument1, argument2, ...</PRE>
	<P>When you don't write an open parenthesis, SoftWire will automatically assume 
		that you want to use this 'implicit' argument list. The argument list stops at 
		the end of the line, so it is not possible to nest multiple macros without 
		using parenthesis.</P>
	<P>
		Sometimes it can be rather unhandy to work with the Assembler class if all you 
		need is the machine code. To&nbsp;have the&nbsp;control&nbsp;over the code and 
		safely delete the Assembler instance without destroying the code, use the <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			Assembler::aquire()</FONT> method. This method returns the pointer to the 
		machine code, and tells the Assembler not to delete it at the destructor. Note 
		that it is still necessary to first use <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">Assembler::callable(entryLabel)</FONT>
		to get the pointer(s) to your function(s). If <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">aquire()</FONT>
		is called before any call to <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">callable()</FONT>, 
		it will return zero.</P>
	<P>To minimize memory usage,&nbsp;call Assembler::finalize() after retrieving the 
		pointers to the functions. This is especially useful for sub-classing 
		Assembler. It will delete all temporary memory used by the scanner, parser, 
		instruction table and intermediate code. Any futher assembling tasks like using 
		a run-time intrinsic will result in an exception to be thrown. The generated 
		machine code is still property of Assembler unless you also call aquire().</P>
	<P><STRONG><U>4. Run-Time Intrinsics</U></STRONG></P>
	<P>SoftWire also supports another form of run-time code generation. With every 
		assembly instruction corresponds a member function of Assembler with the same 
		name. These functions encode the corresponding instruction and put it in the 
		Loader so it is ready to execute. These run-time intrinsics are ideal for 
		writing a compiler back-end. Because it is all written in C++, things like 
		conditional compilation become trivial. Check the tutorial at 
		softwire.sourceforge.net for practical information.</P>
	<P>You need to construct a <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">SoftWire::CodeGenerator</FONT>, 
		after including <EM>CodeGenerator.hpp</EM>.</P>
	<P>You can use the usual register names directly when deriving from <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			CodeGenerator</FONT> . For example <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">add(eax, 
			ebx);</FONT> is valid in&nbsp;<FONT face="Courier New" size="2">CodeGenerator</FONT>
		's scope and its subclasses. For memory operands, you need to use <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			dword_ptr [...]</FONT> and the like. Note that all syntax checks should 
		happen at compile-time. An exception is that it's impossible to check the scale 
		factor in a memory reference.</P>
	<P>To add labels, you need to use the <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">Assembler::label()</FONT>
		method. For example to create an array of 100 uninitialized bytes:</P>
	<PRE>label("table");<BR>db(byte_ptr [100]);</PRE>
	<P>
		Note that it doesn't matter if you use <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">byte_ptr</FONT>
		or any other specifier here, it is only needed to have a valid C++ syntax. To 
		reference the data or function at&nbsp;a label, also use a string literal. This 
		works on any instruction which can accept a 32-bit immediate, like <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			jmp</FONT>, <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">call</FONT>, <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			push</FONT>, <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">dd</FONT>, etc.</P>
	<P>Take a look at <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">testIntrinsics()</FONT> in 
		Test.cpp for&nbsp;some simple working example code. Check the tutorial at 
		softwire.sourceforge.net for detailed examples. The swShader project 
		(sw-shader.sourceforge.net) also uses run-time intrinsics intensively.</P>
	<P>Because <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">and</FONT>, <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			not</FONT>, <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">or</FONT> and <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			xor</FONT> are both assembly instructions and reserved C++ keywords, the 
		compiler should ignore them. In Visual C++ they are not recognised as keywords, 
		but with GCC you need the <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">-fno-operator-names</FONT>
		option to allow run-time intrinsics.</P>
	<P>To simplify debugging of a code generator which uses intrinsics, there is an <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			Assembler::setEchoFile</FONT> method. This function takes the name of a 
		file where SoftWire will copy the textual assembly code corresponding with 
		the&nbsp;intrinsic. This way you can check the output without using a 
		disassembler. There's also an <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">Assembler::annotate</FONT>
		method to comment your generated code.&nbsp;It will put a&nbsp;semicolon at the 
		start of the line,&nbsp;so the echo file can also be used as the input for 
		SoftWire.</P>
	<P>
		The <EM>Intrinsics.hpp</EM> file can take a while to compile.&nbsp;If run-time 
		intrinsics are not needed in your project but fast compilation is a must, 
		define <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">SOFTWIRE_NO_INTRINSICS</FONT> before 
		including <EM>Assembler.hpp</EM>.</P>
	<P><STRONG><U>5. Automatic Register Allocation</U></STRONG></P>
	<P>Now that you know how run-time intrinsics work, let's take this to the next 
		level. I already mentioned that things like conditional compilation become 
		trivial because it's all written in C++, but we can do lot's more like 
		eliminating redundant operation with peephole optimization, and automatic 
		register allocation.</P>
	<P>The latter has been integrated into SoftWire 4.0.0 and newer versions. Basically 
		what it does is mapping variables in memory to registers. When there are more 
		variables than physical registers, it automatically spills registers. This 
		enables you to implement any kind of compiler, from a full-blown C++ compiler 
		to a simple scripting language without worrying about the low-level stuff. It's 
		almost like directly writing intermediate code!</P>
	<P>Because this adds an extra level of abstraction it is not implemented in the 
		Assembler class, but in a subclass called <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">CodeGenerator</FONT>
		. The main reason it was not added to Assembler is because if you only need a 
		simple assembler you can define <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">SOFTWIRE_NO_INTRINSICS
		</FONT>to keep things lightweight. The CodeGenerator class could later also 
		feature optimizations like scheduling which do not guarantee a 1-to-1 mapping 
		of the assembly code to the machine code.</P>
	<P>The first and most important new method is <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">CodeGenerator::r32()</FONT>. 
		It takes a memory reference as argument and returns a general purpose register 
		(not including esp and ebp). For MMX and SSE registers you can use <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			CodeGenerator::r64()</FONT> and <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">CodeGenerator::r128()</FONT>
		respectively. It is advisable to derive your own code generator from&nbsp;<FONT face="Courier New" size="2">CodeGenerator</FONT>
		so the class name can be ommited. Example:</P>
	<P dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><FONT face="Courier New" size="2">class 
			ScriptCompiler : pulic CodeGenerator<BR>
			{<BR>
			public:<BR>
			void generateCode()<BR>
			{</FONT><FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			<BR>
			&nbsp; static int foo;</FONT><FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			<BR>
			&nbsp; mov(r32(&amp;foo), 0x12345678);</FONT><FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			<BR>
			...</FONT></P>
	<P>It works just as well with non-static variables, like variables on the stack:</P>
	<PRE>mov(r32(esp+12), 0x12345678);</PRE>
	<P><FONT face="Times New Roman">Or if you're indexing an array of ints 'array' with an 
			index 'index' and store that in 'value':</FONT></P>
	<PRE>mov(r32(&amp;value), dword_ptr[r32(&amp;array)+r32(&amp;index)*4]);</PRE>
	<P>So there is no need to worry anymore what register is used where or if it is 
		available. You treat them all like variables in memory and SoftWire 
		automatically places them into registers.</P>
	<P>After the operations on the variable are done, we would like to write it back to 
		memory. This&nbsp;can be&nbsp;done with the&nbsp;<FONT face="Courier New" size="2">spill()</FONT>
		method, which takes&nbsp;a register or&nbsp;reference as argument. The register 
		to which the variable is allocated then becomes available again. Another method 
		that does this is <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">free()</FONT>. The 
		difference with spill is that&nbsp;free does not write the variable's data back 
		to memory. This is useful for registers that are only needed temporarily, more 
		about that later. When an instruction can only work on for example eax, you 
		should spill or free eax before using this instruction. Also beware that at 
		branches you have to spill all used variables. This can also be done with the <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			spillAll() <FONT face="Times New Roman" size="3">method, or with <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
					freeAll()</FONT> if you've written back all results yourself.</FONT></FONT></P>
	<P>The above example is not optimal, since SoftWire will copy the data from 
		[esp+12] to the allocated register, and it then immediately gets overwritten 
		with 0x12345678. To eliminate this redundant copying, use the <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			x32()</FONT> method instead, or x64/x128 for MMX/SSE. This function works 
		just like r32 but does not copy the data from the memory reference to the 
		register. This is mainly useful for temporary registers. Have a look at the <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			TestRegisterAllocator</FONT> class in Test.cpp for a working example.</P>
	<P>Because some intermediate instructions can be complex and require temporary 
		variables in physical registers for speed, there's also the <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			t32()</FONT> method, or t64/t128 for MMX/SSE. This function does not take a 
		reference to a memory location as argument, but only an index.&nbsp;The 
		function returns a register that will never be spilled. Therefore you can only 
		use indices 0 to 5 for 32-bit registers and 0 to 7 for MMX/SSE registers. The 
		difference with using the registers directly is that it does not interfere with 
		the regiser allocator, and if necessary it spills the register with lowest 
		priority first. So there is no 1-to-1 mapping of t32 registers to the physical 
		registers. Free them as soon as possible to avoid unnecessary spilling or 
		running out of registers! To avoid this complexity, just stick to the r32 or 
		x32 functions. The only advantage of t32 is that you don't need a memory 
		location where the register can be written to if it needs to be spilled.</P>
	<P>To optimize memory accesses, there is also a <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">m32()</FONT>
		method, or m64/m128 for MMX/SSE. This function returns either a register or a 
		memory reference. many instructions can accept a r/m32 argument, and of course 
		registers are more efficient. If the variable is already located in a register, 
		m32 will return that register, else it will return the memory reference.
	</P>
	<P>The register allocator assumes that all six general purpose registers are 
		available, and all MMX and SSE registers. It is your task to save and restore 
		registers before using automatic register allocation.</P>
	<P>The spilling heuristic uses&nbsp;the access frequency to find the best candidate 
		for spilling. When a register is allocated, it has the highest priority, 
		meaning that it is the worst candidate for the next spill. For every access of 
		a register, all other registers loose priority. This also means that less 
		recently used registers have a lower priority. When spilling is needed, the 
		register with lowest priority is written back to its memory location.</P>
	<P>The <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">CodeGenerator</FONT> class automatically 
		does some trivial peephole optimizations. To disable this behaviour, define <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			SOFTWIRE_NO_PEEPHOLE</FONT> before including <EM>CodeGenerator.hpp</EM>.</P>
	<P><U><STRONG>6. Design</STRONG></U></P>
	<P>The whole library is encapsulated in a namespace called <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			SoftWire</FONT>. This is to prevent name clashes with other projects.</P>
	<P>The only class you'll need for assembling a file and getting a pointer to the 
		callable code is <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">Assembler</FONT>. It has to 
		be constructed with the name of the .asm file which contains the assembly code. 
		The assembler treats it as one block of code, and you can get a void pointer to 
		the assembled code by calling the <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">callable()</FONT>
		method. By default the entry point will be a label with the same name as the 
		file. You can also pass the name of a label as the entry point if you want to 
		start excecution from another line. To effectively call the function, you first 
		need to cast it to an appropriate&nbsp;function pointer. When the Assembler is 
		destructed, it also deletes the assembled code. To prevent this and control the 
		lifetime of the code yourself, call the <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">acquire()</FONT>
		method. This will return a pointer to the start of the code. This is not 
		necessarily the entry point of the code, so you still need to use <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			callable()<FONT face="Times New Roman" size="3">.</FONT></FONT></P>
	<P>The first class the assembler will use for processing the assembly file is the <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			Scanner</FONT>. This class has the task to break up the source code into 
		words, called tokens. It is also resposible for the preprocessing tasks like 
		file inclusion, conditional compilation and macro expansion. The <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			Macro</FONT> class helps with this last task.</P>
	<P>The tokens are stored in a <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">Token</FONT> class. 
		The scanner also recognizes tokens as being identifiers, constants or 
		punctuators. The scanner does not recognize keywords (except preprocessor 
		directives) and does no syntax checking. The whole file is scanned at once and 
		the tokens are placed in a <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">TokenList</FONT> class.</P>
	<P>Every source line of tokens then goes to the <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">Parser</FONT>. 
		It will recognize the keywords, check the syntax and pass the information like 
		mnemonic and registers to the code generator.</P>
	<P>The code generation is done with the <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">Synthesizer</FONT>
		class. It will put the information from the parsed instruction into bytes for 
		the machine code.</P>
	<P>The rules for the code generation are stored in the <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			InstructionSet</FONT> class. The parser uses this class to select the 
		matching instruction(s), and the synthesizer uses it to know how to encode the 
		instruction.</P>
	<P>The bytes from the synthesizer are stored into an <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">Encoding</FONT>
		class. It also stores information about labels and references to labels to 
		resolve jump addresses.</P>
	<P>All encodings are stored in the <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">Loader</FONT> class. 
		After all instructions have been assembled, this class will resolve all the 
		references and write the machine-code bytes into a buffer. Externally declared 
		data will be resolved by the assembler's <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">Linker</FONT>
		class. The loader also searches for the code entry point. When the assembler is 
		destructed, the assembled code is also destroyed, except when using <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			acquire()</FONT>. The linker data is also cleared.</P>
	<P>When a syntax error occurs, the assembler throws an <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			Error</FONT> class. This class simply holds a string with the error 
		description. This message will be printed to the console by using the <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			DebugOutput::printf</FONT> method. You can easily use your custom error 
		output system by deriving from the DebugOutput class. Besides syntax errors, 
		the assembler might also throw internal errors. This is an alternative to <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
			assert()</FONT>, so it should not happen. If you get an internal error, or 
		worse, an unhandled exception, please contact the author.</P>
	<P>Run-time intrinsics are generated by the <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">InstructionSet</FONT>, 
		and stored in <EM>Intrinsics.hpp</EM> . You need to uncomment the&nbsp;<FONT face="Courier New" size="2">generateIntrinsics()</FONT>
		line in the <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">InstructionSet</FONT> constructor 
		when you've made changes to the instruction set and need new intrinsics. Do not 
		attempt to modify the <EM>Intrinsics.hpp</EM> file manually. The arguments for 
		the intrinsics are defined in <EM>Operand.hpp</EM>.</P>

		<LI>
		Jude Venn: helped porting SoftWire to UNIX/Linux by providing alternative 
		functions for the Microsoft specific code (File.hpp, String.hpp, CharType.hpp). 
		He also wrote Makefile.gcc to easily compile SoftWire with GCC.
		<LI>
		'Carrot': reported and fixed missing FMULP and other variants and JNEA 
		misspelling.
		<LI>
		Walt Woods: reported and fixed memory leak in InstructionSet. Reported bug with 
		"push imm" instruction not pushing dwords for small integers. Fixed stack 
		overflow with TokenLink destructor.
		<LI>
		Edwin Young: reported 16-bit register bug in Factorial.asm.
		<LI>
		'tawai': reported bug with single-argument IMUL instruction.
		<LI>
		Rene Dudfield: reported 3DNow! instruction encoding bugs. Helped SoftWire 3.0.0 
		to compiler under Linux.
		<LI>
		Oscar Fuentes: reported missing&nbsp;addressing mode&nbsp;for run-time 
		intrinsics and helped SoftWire 3 to compile with GCC and Intel compilers. 
		Suggested methods to change ownership of machine code.
		<LI>
		Florian Bösch: Reported bugs in run-time intrinsics with references to labels.
		<LI>
		Blake Pelton: Reported small memory leaks caused by strdup() use.
		<LI>
		'IanM': Contributed changes to assemble from source string.
		<LI>
			Dario Pelella: Fixed "push imm" bug with specifiers. Reported FPU instructions 
			bug with '+r' encoding.</LI></UL>
	<P>If you feel like you should also have been mentioned on this list (or be removed 
		or have something changed), please do not hesitate to contact me 
		to&nbsp;correct this mistake.</P>
	<P>Why are contributions, bug fixes and copyrights not indicated in the code? I do 
		not like this because in my opinion source files should be kept as readable as 
		possible. I think it is very annoying that you first have to scroll past a huge 
		block of comments that don't have anything to do with the code itself. Source 
		files are for code. Licence and readme files are for the things not directly 
		related to the code but to the library as a whole. If you cannot agree with 
		this point of view and have some strong arguments, please contact me to discuss 
		it.</P>

	<P>SoftWire is a work-in-progress, so every kind of feedback is welcome, good or 
		bad. I'm also always willing to help you out if you don't get something 
		working. If you're a C++ guru and you would have designed some parts 
		differently, I'm all ears. Contact me via e-mail at <A href="mailto:nicolas@capens.net">
