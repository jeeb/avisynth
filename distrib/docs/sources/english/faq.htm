<h2> Avisynth Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<b>Remark</b>: a more recent version can be found <a href="faq_sections.htm">here</a> and
at <a href="http://www.avisynth.org"><cite>http://www.avisynth.org</cite></a>
<p>The faq is divided into four sections: a general section, one related
to frameserving, one related to filters and plugins, and one related to
importing VirtualDub filters. Recently, the old stuff "related to AviSynth
v2.06 and older versions" is removed. Thus, if you have problems, make
sure that you install a more recent version of AviSynth.

<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="q1.1"></a><b>Q1.1: What is AviSynth ?</b>
<p>A: AviSynth (AVI SYNTHesizer) is a frameserver. An excellent discription
is given on <a href="http://neuron2.net/LVG/avisynth.html"> Lukes homepage</a>:
<p>"AviSynth is a very useful utility created by Ben Rudiak-Gould. It provides
many options for joining and filtering videos. What makes AviSynth unique
is the fact that it is not a stand-alone program that produces output files.
Instead, AviSynth acts as the "middle man" between your videos and video
applications.
<p>Basically, AviSynth works like this: First, you create a simple text
document with special commands, called a script. These commands make references
to one or more videos and the filters you wish to run on them. Then, you
run a video application, such as VirtualDub, and open the script file.
This is when AviSynth takes action.&nbsp; It opens the videos you referenced
in the script, runs the specified filters, and feeds the output to video
application. The application, however, is not aware that AviSynth is working
in the background.&nbsp; Instead, the application thinks that it is directly
opening a filtered AVI file that resides on your hard drive.
<p>There are five main reasons why you would want to use AviSynth:
<ol type="1">&nbsp;
<li>
Join Videos: AviSynth lets you join together any number of videos, including
segmented AVIs. You can even selectively join certain portions of a video
or dub soundtracks.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Filter Videos: Many video processing filters are built in to AviSynth.
For example, filters for resizing, cropping, and sharpening your videos.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Break the 2 GB Barrier: AviSynth feeds a video to a program rather than
letting the program directly open the video itself. Because of this, you
can usually use AviSynth to open files larger than 2 GB in programs that
don't natively support files of that size.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Open Unsupported Formats: AviSynth can open almost any type of video, including
MPEGs and certain Quicktime MOVs. However, when AviSynth feeds video to
a program, it looks just like a standard AVI to that program. This allows
you to open certain video formats in programs that normally wouldn't support
them.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Save Disk Space: AviSynth generates the video that it feeds to a program
on the fly. Therefore, no temporary or intermediate videos are created.
Because of this, you save disk space."</li>
</ol>

<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="q1.2"></a><b>Q1.2: Who is developing AviSynth ?</b>
<p>A: AviSynth (up to v1.0b) is developed by Ben Rudiak-Gould, see <a href="http://math.berkeley.edu/~benrg/avisynth.html">http://math.berkeley.edu/~benrg/avisynth.html</a>.&nbsp;
Ben stopped developing and Edwin van Eggelen continued, see <a href="http://www.videotools.net/uk/download.php">http://www.videotools.net/uk/download.php</a>.
His latest release is version v1.0b6 which can be found on Edwins homepage
given above.
<p>Some versions appeared on the AviSynth forum, for example <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?s=&threadid=18243">v1.0b7a
by Divine</a> and <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?s=&threadid=18243">v1.0b7d
by Dividee</a>.
<p>In the beginning of July 2002 there was a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/avisynth2/">second revision (v2.0x)</a> of the sourceforge
project.&nbsp; (In the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/avisynth/">first
sourceforge project</a> didn't happen much.)</p>
<p>The most recent version is v2.5x series, 
weekly builds v2.5.0-2.5.5 by leading developer Klaus Post were <a href="http://cultact-server.novi.dk/kpo/avisynth/avs_cvs.html">here</a>.
The main developer of AviSynth v2.5.6-2.5.7 is Ian Brabham (IanB). Many other people contributed to AviSynth.

<p>other bugs can be found in the documentation on the project page, see
<a href="#q1.5">Q1.5</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="q1.5"></a><b>Q1.5: Where can I find documentation about AviSynth
?</b>
<p>A: Documentation about the filters of AviSynth can be found on this
site <a href="http://www.avisynth.org/">http://www.avisynth.org/</a>, and
also on the <a href="corefilters.htm">filters</a> page. For a tutorial on
avisynth scripting, have a look at <a href="syntax.htm">this page</a>.
<b>You
should read these documents before posting to the forum</b> (but it's OK
to post if you have trouble understanding them).
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="q1.6"></a><b>Q1.6: How do I install/uninstall AviSynth ?</b>
<p>A: In v2.05 or older versions: move avisynth.dll to your system/system32
directory and run install.reg. Starting from v2.06 AviSynth comes with
an auto installer. <b>Also make sure you have no other versions of AviSynth
floating around on your harddisc, because there is a change that one of
those versions will be registered. Remove them if necessary.</b> For uninstalling
AviSynth go to "program", "AviSynth 2" and select "Uninstall AviSynth".
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="q1.7"></a><b>Q1.7: Is there any difference between v1.0x, v2.0x
or v2.5x ?</b>
<p>A: The versions v1.0x and v2.0x are compatible (the main difference
is that v2.0x doesn't contain IPCSource, while it contains other filters
which are not present in v1.0x).&nbsp; The main difference with v2.5x is
that the internal structure of AviSynth has changed (YV12 and multichannel
support) with the consequence that <b>external plugins compiled for v1.0x
or v2.0x will not work for v2.5x and vice versa</b>.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="q1.8"></a><b>Q1.8: Are plugins compiled for v2.5x compatible
with v1.0x/v2.0x and vice versa ?</b>
<p>A: As explained in <a href="#q1.7">Q1.7</a> that is not the case.&nbsp;
However it is possible to use a v1.0x/v2.0x plugin in v2.5x, see <a href="#q1.15">Q1.15</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="q1.9"></a><b>Q1.9: Which encoding programs support YV12 ?</b>
<p>A: There are several options for encoding to DivX/XviD:
<ol>
<li>
There is a modified version (called VirtualdubMod) which has YV12 support:&nbsp;
This modification (by pulco-citron, Suiryc and Belgador) has OGM and AVS-preview
support.&nbsp; It can be downloaded from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualdubmod">here</a>.&nbsp;
In order to use the YV12 support (without doing any color conversions)
you have to load your AVI in VirtualdubMod and select "<b>fast recompress</b>".</li>

<li>
VirtualDub support YV12 starting from v1.5.6.&nbsp; In order to use the
YV12 support (without doing any color conversions) you have to load your
AVI in VirtualDub and select "<b>fast recompress</b>".</li>

<li>
For easy (and fast) YV12 support, you can also try out the new commandline
compressor: AVS2AVI, see also <a href="#q1.21">Q1.21</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p><br><a NAME="q1.10"></a><b>Q1.10: How do I use v2.5x if the encoding
programs can't handle YV12 (like Virtualdub, TMPGEnc or CCE SP) ?</b>
<p>A: Using Virtualdub you have to add "<a href="corefilters/convert.htm">ConvertToYUY2</a>"
to your script or you have to install a YV12 decompressor like DivX5 or
one of the recent XviD builds of Koepi (<a href="http://roeder.goe.net/~koepi/xvid.shtml">XviD-04112002-1
or newer</a>).&nbsp; Enabling "fast recompress" implies that there will
be a YV12 --> YUY2 --> YV12 conversion.&nbsp; (DivX3/4 also supports YV12,
except that PIV users could experience <a href="http://www.divx-digest.com/software/divxcodec4.html">crashes</a>
when encoding to DivX4 in YV12.)
<p>Using TMPGEnc you have to add the line <a href="corefilters/convert.htm">ConvertToRGB24</a>
to your script, and for CCE SP you need to add the line <a href="corefilters/convert.htm">ConvertToYUY2</a>
to your script, since Windows has no internal YV12 compressor.&nbsp; You
can also install DivX5 one of the recent XviD builds of Koepi (<a href="http://roeder.goe.net/~koepi/xvid.shtml">XviD-04112002-1
or newer</a>) which will decompress the YV12-AVI for you when loading the
avi in TMPGEnc or CCE SP.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="q1.11"></a><b>Q1.11: How do I use with AviSynth v2.5 with Gordian
Knot?</b>
<p>- If you are using GKnot 0.26 you have to rename mpeg2dec3.dll (the
one for AviSynth v2.5) to mpeg2dec.dll, and virtualdubmod.exe to virtualdub.exe
(keeping copies of the original exe and dll somewhere).
<p>- If you are using GKnot 0.27 you can follow the same procedure as above,
or you can enter mpeg2dec3.dll as an alternative mpeg2dec.dll in the options
menu and rename virtualdubmod.exe to virtualdub.exe.
<p>- But you can also try the new GKnot 0.28.
<p>If you are using VirtualdubMod 1.4.13.1 older and experience problems,
download the latest <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=65889&release_id=130443">prerelease</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="q1.12"></a><b>Q1.12: What are the main advantages and processing/encoding
in YV12?</b>
<p>A: There are two advantages:
<ul>
<li>
<i>speed increase:</i></li>

<br>It depends entirely on the external plugins whether they will have
YV12 support or not.&nbsp; If they have then speed increases like 25-35
percent are expected.&nbsp; Of course there will only be a large speed
increase if both your source and target are in YV12, for example in DVD
to DivX/Xvid conversions.
<li>
<i>no color conversions:</i></li>

<br>The color information doesn't get interpolated (so often) and thus
stays more realistic.&nbsp; Even if you have to do color conversions (because
your are encoding with CCE SP or TMPGEnc) you have the advantage that putting
off the YV12->YUY2 (or RGB24 for TMPGEnc) conversion until the end of the
script allows you to first IVTC or Deinterlace to create progressive frames.&nbsp;
But the YV12 to YUY2 conversion for progressive frames maintains more chroma
detail than it does for interlaced or field based frames.</ul>

<p><br><a NAME="q1.13"></a><b>Q1.13: Is there a command line utility for
encoding to DivX/XviD using AviSynth ?</b>
<p>A: As explained in <a href="#q1.9">Q1.9</a> there is a command line
utility called <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?s=&threadid=36768">AVS2AVI</a>
(and AVS2AVI GUI) for encoding to DivX/XviD using AviSynth.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="q1.14"></a><b>Q1.14: Where can I find VCF2AVS ?</b>
<p>A: VCF2AVS is a nice litte tool to convert vcf to avs files. You can
edit your captures in vdub (basically cutting, cropping and resizing),
then edit the resulting avs. Be carefull since there are two versions floating
around:
<ul>
<li>
VCF2AVS by Darksoul71 which can be found <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?s=&threadid=41927">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
VCF2AVS by BB (more basic) which can be found <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?s=&threadid=30587">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
Try them both and look which one fullfills your needs :)
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="q1.15"></a><b>Q1.15: How do I use a plugin compiled for v2.0x
in v2.5x ?</b>
<p>A: In <a href="#JapanesePlugin">WarpSharp-package for AviSynth v2.5x</a>
you will find a plugin called "LoadPluginEx.dll". <b>When using an older
version of LoadPluginEx.dll, don't move this plugin to your plugin dir.&nbsp;
But move it to a separate dir, otherwise VirtualdubMod and WMP6.4 will
crash on exist.</b>&nbsp; This will enable you using v2.0x plugins in v2.5x.&nbsp;
An example script (using the v2.0x plugin Dust by Steady):
<p><i>LoadPlugin("C:\Program Files\avisynth2_temp\plugins\LoadPluginEx.dll")</i>
<br><i>LoadPlugin("C:\Program Files\avisynth2_temp\plugins\dustv5.dll")</i>
<p><i>AviSource("D:\clip.avi").ConvertToYUY2</i>
<br><i>PixieDust(5)</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="q1.16"></a><b>Q1.16: How do I switch between differents AviSynth
versions without re-install ?</b>
<p>A:
<ul>
<li>
You can use AvisynthSwitcher available <a href="http://www.lalternative.org">here</a>.&nbsp;
Versions 2.08 and 2.50 are provided, but you can easily add a new one under
AvisynthSwitcher\versions\Avisynth 2.x.x.</li>

<li>
Some other ways are described <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?s=&threadid=45181">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><br><a NAME="q1.17"></a><b>Q1.17: How do I make an AVS-file ?</b>
<p>A: See <a href="#q1.19">Q1.19</a> (using the text editor you prefer).
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="q1.18"></a><b>Q1.18: Where do I save my AVS-file ?</b>
<p>A: Anywhere on your harddrive.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="q1.19"></a><b>Q1.19: How do I know which version number of
AviSynth I have ?</b>
<p>A: Open a text-editor, for example notepad. At the following line
<p><a href="corefilters/version.htm">Version</a>
<p>and save the file with the extension "avs".&nbsp; Save for example as
version.avs (make sure that the extension is "avs" and not "txt").&nbsp;
Open the file in an application which can read AVI-files, for example WMP
6.4. The version number will be displayed.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="q1.20"></a><b>Q1.20: Does AviSynth have a GUI (graphical user
interface) ?</b>
<p>A: Several nice tools are available:
<ul>
<li>
VirtualdubMod, see also <a href="#q1.9">Q1.9</a>.&nbsp; Regarding to AviSynth
the following utilities are added:</li>
</ul>

<p>A : AviSynth (especially v2.5x) is highly optimized. As a consequence
it is possible that your computer seems to crash at random during a second
pass. Try running the [<a href="http://www.mersenne.org/freesoft.htm">Prime95</a>]
stress test for an hour, to check if your system is stable. If this test
fails (or your computer locks up) make sure that your computer is not overclocked

the crashes are gone.

<p><br><a NAME="s2"></a><b><font size=+1>S2: AviSynth and frameserving:</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="q2.1"></a><b>Q2.1: What is frameserving and what is it good
for ?</b>
<p>A: An excellent discription is found on <a href="http://neuron2.net/LVG/frameserving.html"> Lukes homepage</a>:
<p>"Frameserving is a process by which you directly transfer video data
from one program on your computer to another. No intermediate or temporary
files are created. The program that opens the source file(s) and outputs
the video data is called the frameserver. The program that receives the
data could be any type of video application.
<p>There are two main reasons that you would want to frameserve a video:
<ol type="1">&nbsp;
<li>
Save Disk Space:</li>

<br>Depending the on the frameserving application, you can usually edit/process
your video as it is being frameserved. Because frameserving produces no
intermediate files, you can use a frameserver to alter your videos without
requiring any additional disk space. For example, if you wanted to join
two video files, resize them, and feed them to another video application,
frameserving would allow you to do this without creating a large intermediate
file.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Increased Compatibility:</li>

<br>To the video application that's receiving the frameserved video, the
input looks like a relatively small, uncompressed video file. However,
the source file that the frameserver is transferring could actually be,
for example, a highly compressed MPEG-1 video. If your video application
doesn't support MPEG-1 files, it's not a problem because the application
is just receiving standard uncompressed video from the frameserver. This
feature of frameserving enables you to open certain types of files in an
application that wouldn't normally support them.</ol>

<p><br>Furthermore, because the video application is being fed the source
video one frame at a time, it doesn't know anything about the file size
of the source video. Therefore, if your application has 2 GB or 4 GB limit
on input file size, it won't have any effect on your frameserved video.
You could feed 100 GB of video via a frameserver to an application limited
to 2 GB and it wouldn't cause a problem."
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="q2.2"></a><b>Q2.2: How do I use AviSynth as a frameserver ?</b>
<p>A: Write a script using a text editor. Load your clip (see <a href="#q2.8">Q2.8</a>)
in AviSynth, do the necessary filtering and load the AVS-file in encoder/application
X (must be an encoder or application which can read AVI-files, see <a href="#q2.3">Q2.3</a>
and <a href="#q2.4">Q2.4</a>).
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="q2.3"></a><b>Q2.3: How do I frameserve my AVS-file to encoder/application
X ?</b>
<p>A:
<ul>
<li>
Frameserving to TMPGEnc, CCE SP, VirtualDub or WMP6.4:</li>

<br>Just open your AVS-file in TMPGEnc, CCE SP, VirtualDub or WMP6.4 (or
whatever encoder/application you use) and have a look at <a href="#q2.4">Q2.4</a>.</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Frameserving to VFAPI:</li>

<br>For VFAPI you need to install the <a href="http://www.vcdhelp.com/forum/userguides/87270.php">ReadAVS</a>
plugin. Just copy ReadAVS.dll to the VFAPI reader directory and open the
reg-file ReadAVS.reg in notepad and change the corresponding path. Save
it, and doubleclick on it to merge it with your registry-file.</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Frameserving to Premiere or Ulead:</li>

<ul>
<li>
For frameserving to Premiere there exists an import plugin "IM-Avisynth.prm".
The original version can be downloaded from <a href="http://math.berkeley.edu/~benrg/avisynth-premiere.html">Bens
site</a>. A much improved version can be downloaded from the [<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/videoeditorskit/">Video Editors Kit sourceforge
page</a>]. This works for Premiere 5.x,6.x and Pro at present. To install the import plugin move the IM-Avisynth.prm file
into your Premiere "Plug-ins" directory.</li>

<li>
You can also download a program called [<a href="http://cultact-server.novi.dk/kpo/avisynth/avs_cvs.html">makeAVIS
(included in the ffvfw codec package</a>] (this is an AVI Wrapper), [<a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?s=&threadid=49964">discussion</a>].
Note that this program is included in the installation of AviSynth v2.52.
For Ulead you must use this program.</li>

<li>
<i>Why can't I open my AVS-file in TMPGEnc (this happens in old versions

<i>CCE SP crashes when reading an AVS-file, what to do ?</i></li>

<ul>
<li>
If you're using Win2k then run CCE in WinNT4-SP5 compatibility mode.</li>

<li>
If you're frameserving with AviSynth v1.0x/v2.0x put "<a href="corefilters/resampleaudio.htm">ResampleAudio</a>(44100)"
in your script, even if you don't have any audio in your AVS-file.</li>

<li>
If you're frameserving with AviSynth v2.5x the ResampleAudio trick doesn't
work anymore because it doesn't add a silent audio stream to your video
clip.&nbsp; Instead make a script (called "addaudio.avsi") as described
<a href="http://www.avisynth.org/index.php?page=AddAudio">here</a>,
and put it in your plugin dir.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>

<li>
<i>Encoders/players (like CCE SP v2.62/v2.64) will not read AVS-files ?</i></li>

<br>Many "new" programs do NOT use the Windows functions to read the AVI-files.
If they do NOT use those standard Windows functions the AviSynth-script
files will not work. Known programs that do NOT use those routines are
CCE SP v2.62, Windows Media Encoder vx.x. Furthermore people report problems
with Windows Media Player 7.
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Use CCE SP v2.50 and WMP6.4 (under "Program Files" and "Windows Media Player"
you will find a file called "mplayer2.exe", this is WMP6.4). In case that
you want to use Windows Media Encoder you can use the AVI Wrapper "makeAVIS"
instead, see<a href="#q2.3"> Q2.3</a>. For Windows Media Encoder 9 have
a look at <a href="#q2.3">Q2.3</a>.</li>

<li>
If you still want to use CCE SP v2.62 you can try the following: Frameserve
to CCE SP v2.62 with VFAPI. Create an AVS script and then make a fake AVI
with VFAPI (VFAPI accepts AVS-files, see <a href="#q2.3">Q2.3</a>, and
can be downloaded from Dooms site).</li>

<li>
Cinemacraft says that their CCE SP v2.66 can accept AviSynth scripts.&nbsp;
So if you have this version you sould be safe.<br>

<p><a NAME="s3"></a><b><font size=+1>S3: Filters and colorspaces:</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="q3.1"></a><b>Q3.1: What is RGB/YUV-colorspace ?</b>
<p>A: These are two different ways to represent colors: YUV colorspace
and RGB colorspace.&nbsp; In YUV colorspace there is one component that
represent lightness (luma) and two other components that represent color
(chroma).&nbsp; As long as the luma is conveyed with full detail, detail
in the chroma components can be reduced by subsampling (filtering, or averaging)
which can be done in several ways (thus there are multiple formats for
storing a picture in YUV colorspace).&nbsp; In RGB colorspace there are
three components, one for the amount of Red, one for the amount of Green
and one for the amount of Blue.&nbsp; Also in the colorspace there are
multiple formats for storing a picture which differ in the amount of samples
are used for one of the three colors.
<p>Information can be found here: <a href="http://www.fourcc.org/fccyuv.htm">YUV
Formats</a>, <a href="http://www.fourcc.org/fccrgb.htm">RGB Formats</a>,

<p>As of AviSynth v1.0x/v2.0x, RGB24, RGB32, and YUY2 are supported.&nbsp;
In AviSynth v2.5x there is also support for YV12.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="q3.2"></a><b>Q3.2: In which colorspaces do AviSynth and the
internal filters work ?</b>
<p>A: AviSynth works in RGB and YUV using the RGB32, RGB24, YUY2 and YV12
formats.&nbsp; Most of the internal filters work in any of these formats,
too. Which color format a filter requires, can be found [<a href="quick_ref.htm">here</a>].
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="q3.3"></a><b>Q3.3: How do I load a plugin in to AviSynth ?</b>
<p>A: Starting from v2.05 you can use its auto-plugin loading feature.
The path of the plugin directory is set during install. But if you want
to change it for some reason, change or add the following lines:
<p><i>REGEDIT4</i>
<p><i>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Avisynth]</i>
<br><i>"PluginDir"="c:\\program files\\avisynth 2.5\\plugins"</i>
<p>Change the path above if necessary and make sure you created the plugin-dir
as well. Save it as install_autoplugin.reg, and merge it to your registry
file by right-clicking on it in your explorer. Finally move all your plugins/script-functions
into the plugin directory. If you want to load plugins manually, use "LoadPlugin".
An example script:
<p><i>LoadPlugin("d:\mpeg2dec.dll")</i>
<br><i>mpeg2source("d:\filename.d2v")</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="q3.4"></a><b>Q3.4: Where can I download external filters for
AviSynth v1.0x/v2.0x ?</b>
<p>A: Most of them can be found in the AviSynth section at Doom9. But below
you will find links to most of them. If you know of a plugin which is missing,
please feel free to add it to the list using the "Edit this document" link
to the left. Most of these plugins work in YUY2. If you can't find the

When colors change just a little, the filter decides that it is probably
noise, and only slightly changes the color from the previous frame. As
the change in color increases, the filter becomes more and more convinced

<p><br><a NAME="q3.7"></a><b>Q3.7: How do I convert between the colorspaces
?</b>
<p>A: If you are using mpeg2dec3 (the appropriate one for AviSynth v2.5x)
you can also use the conversions available in this dll (for example when
you want to convert to RGB24).&nbsp; Using AviSynth itself:
<p><i>converting to YV12:</i>
<br><a href="corefilters/convert.htm">ConvertToYV12</a>
<p><i>converting to YUY2:</i>
<br><a href="corefilters/convert.htm">ConvertToYUY2</a>
<p><i>converting to RGB:</i>
<br><a href="corefilters/convert.htm">ConvertToRGB</a>
<p>Note that converting between colorspaces isn't completely lossless,
and doing several conversions back and forth may degrade your signal.&nbsp;
The first conversion back and forth does not hurt your source, but if you
use three or more, it may.&nbsp; Starting with version v2.03, there is
a <a href="corefilters/convert.htm">ConvertBackToYUY2</a> which offers better
symmetry if your RGB source was previously converted from YUY2.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="q3.8"></a><b>Q3.8: What/when do I care when filter X works
in RGB- or YUV-space ?</b>
<p>A: The main reason why you should care is the improvement in speed you
can obtain by not unnecessarily changing between colorspaces.&nbsp; If
your source is YV12 (when encoding DVD's for example, or captures from
digital sources) try to use only filters/plugins which work with YV12 input.&nbsp;
On the other hand if your source is in RGB (for example from analog captures)
try to use only filters/plugins which work in RGB-space.
<p>Speed is also quite different between the different colorspaces, because
each colorspace takes up different amounts of memory.&nbsp; The slowest
colorspace is usually RGB24, because every pixel has an odd alignment in
memory, avoid using this mode.&nbsp; The fastest mode is usually YV12 (followed
by YUY2), because data takes less than half as much space as RGB32.&nbsp;
So if you have to process your video a lot, try using ConvertToYV12 or
<a href="corefilters/convert.htm">ConvertToYUY2</a>
before you do your filtering.&nbsp; Note that <a href="corefilters/convert.htm">ConvertToRGB</a>
converts to RGB32 if the source is YV12/YUY2 - use <a href="corefilters/convert.htm">ConvertToRGB32</a>
to force a RGB24 to RGB32 conversion.
<p>You should also consider your destination colorspace.&nbsp; If you plan
on converting to DivX/XviD/Huffyuv in VirtualDub without applying filters
in VirtualDub, "Fast Recompress" will deliver the YUY2-data (or YV12 data
if you use VirtualdubMod) directly to the codec, saving you another colorspace
conversion.&nbsp; On the other hand, if you plan using TMPGEnc or VirtualDub
in "Full Processing" mode, you may consider delivering the source as RGB.

<p><a NAME="q3.9"></a><b>Q3.9: How do I use and where can I get the "Subtitler"
and "BMP Loader" plugins ?</b>
<p>A: These dll files are created by DVD2SVCD and only DVD2SVCD is using
them. But you can also use them in AviSynth. Have a look in this [<a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?s=&threadid=23296">thread</a>].

<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="q4.1"></a><b>Q4.1: Where can I download the latest version

<p>A: The AviSynth scripts are on the <a href="http://www.avisynth.org/index.php?page=ShareFunctions">ShareFunctions</a>
page, or you can download a package called vdub_filtersv15.zip from <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?s=&threadid=23804">http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=23804</a>

<p><a NAME="q4.2"></a><b>Q4.2: Which filters are imported ?</b>
<p>A: Most filters.&nbsp; Read the corresponding documentation available
in the zip-file.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="q4.3"></a><b>Q4.3: Do these scripts work in RGB-space or in
YUV-space ?</b>
<p>A: Only in RGB-space (RGB32).
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="q4.4"></a><b>Q4.4: How do I make such a script ?</b>
<p>A: Example script (this VirtualDub filter can be downloaded from <a href="http://shelob.mordor.net/dgraft/">Donald's
homepage</a>):
<p>Smart Bob by Donald Graft:
<p>function VD_SmartBob(clip <i>clip</i>, bool "<i>show_motion</i>", int
"<i>threshold</i>", bool "<i>motion_map_denoising</i>")
<br>&nbsp; LoadVirtualdubPlugin("d:\bob.vdf", "_VD_SmartBob", 1)
<br>&nbsp; return clip.<a href="corefilters/separatefields.htm">SeparateFields</a>._VD_SmartBob(clip.<a href="syntax.htm">GetParity</a>?1:0,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \&nbsp; default(show_motion, false)?1:0, default(threshold,
10),
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \&nbsp; default(motion_map_denoising, true)?1:0)
<br>}
<p>The VirtualDub plugin is imported with the command "LoadVirtualdubPlugin".&nbsp;
The first argument gives the path of the plugin, the second argument the
name for the plugin that will be used in the script and the third argument
is called the preroll.
<p>The preroll should be set to at least the number of frames the filter
needs to pre-process to fill its buffers and/or updates its internal variables.&nbsp;
This last argument is used in some filters like: SmartBob, SmartDeinterlace,
TemporalCleaner and others.&nbsp; The reason is that due to filtering architecture
of Virtual Dub the future frames can't be accessed by a filter.&nbsp; Dividee
reports: "In the "Add filter" dialog of VirtualDub, some filters have a
"Lag:" value in their description. I think this is the value that must
be used as preroll.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this indication is not always
present.&nbsp; In those cases you have to guess."&nbsp; Of course you can
always ask the creator of the filter.
<p>The first step is to find out the sequence of the arguments in the last
line where the clip is returned.&nbsp; Configure the script in VirtualDub
and select "Save processing Settings" in the File Menu or press Ctrl+S.&nbsp;
Open the created .vcf file with a text editor and you should see lines
like this:
<p>VirtualDub.video.filters.Add("smart bob (1.1 beta 2)");
<br>VirtualDub.video.filters.instance[0].Config(1, 0, 10, 1);
<p>The order of the arguments is the one that has to be used in AviSynth.&nbsp;
To find the role of the arguments, play with them in VirtualDub and examine
the resulting lines.
<p>The second step is to test the filter and to compare it with the VirtualDub
filter itself.&nbsp; For the programming itself you can learn a lot by
looking at the script which are already contained in vdub_filters.avs.
<p>Example script which uses the function VD_SmartBob:
<p>Import("d:\vdub_filters.avs") <br>
  <a href="corefilters/avisource.htm">AviSource</a>("d:\filename.avi") <br>
  <a href="corefilters/convert.htm">ConvertToRGB32</a>&nbsp; # only when necessary 
  (but doesn't hurt) <br>
  VD_SmartBob(1, 0, 10, 1) <br>
  <a href="corefilters/convert.htm">ConvertBackToYUY2</a>&nbsp; # only when necessary
