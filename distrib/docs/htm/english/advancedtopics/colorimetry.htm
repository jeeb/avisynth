<h1>Colorimetry</h1>
<p>When playing back video content, several issues might go wrong. The levels
could be wrong, resulting in washed out colors (black is displayed as dark gray
and white is displayed as light gray). This is described in more detail <a href="http://avisynth.org/mediawiki/Luminance_levels" title="Luminance levels">here</a>.
The other issue is a slight distortion in color (which often looks like a small
change in brightness) and this will be described here.</p>
<p>The problem could arise if your content is created in a different colorspace
as it is stored later on. Usually it is created in RGB, but stored as YCbCr. Upon
display it will be converted back again to RGB. This means that two color
conversions will take place. The problem is that there are different ways of
doing this conversion. If the two color conversions are not the same, the
displayed content won't be the same as the original content. There are many
other colorspaces, but they won't be discussed here. See for example <a href="http://www.poynton.com/notes/colour_and_gamma/ColorFAQ.html" class="external text" title="http://www.poynton.com/notes/colour_and_gamma/ColorFAQ.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>So when converting YCbCr to RGB upon display, the correct color conversion
standard (Rec.601 or Rec.709) must be used, namely the one which was used when
storing the content. (Rec.709 and Rec.601 are short for ITU-R BT.709 and ITU-R
BT.601.)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What are color conversion standards?</span></h2>
<p>There are multiple ways of doing the YCbCr &lt;-&gt; RGB conversion. The
general conversion is given by</p>
<pre>Y = Kr*R + Kg*G + Kb*B
Cb = (B-Y)/(1-Kb)
Cr = (R-Y)/(1-Kr) = R - G * Kg/(1-Kr) - B * Kb/(1-Kr)</pre>
<p>and the other way around:</p>
<pre>R = Y + Cr*(1-Kr)
G = Y - Cb*(1-Kb)*Kb/Kg - Cr*(1-Kr)*Kr/Kg
B = Y + Cb*(1-Kb)</pre>
<p>with (0.0 &lt;= [Y,R,G,B] &lt;= 1.0)&nbsp;; (-1.0 &lt;= [Cb,Cr] &lt;= 1.0)
and Kr + Kg + Kb = 1.</p>
<p>The red, green and blue coefficients (Kr,Kg,Kb) are standardized in
specifications and there are several of them. Have a look at <a href="color_conversions.htm" title="Color conversions">Color_conversions</a>
for examples.</p>
<a name="How_can_I_see_if_the_correct_standard_is_used_upon_playback.3F"></a>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">How can I see if the correct standard is used upon
playback?</span></h2>
<p>That's a tough question, because it's hardly possible to notice if the wrong
standard is used upon playback. In fact, it's hard to see any difference at all
between them. Take a look at the following screenshot:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../pictures/advancedtopics/colorimetry.jpg" width="720" height="736"></p>
<p>The upper picture is shown correctly (using Rec.601), and for the lower one
the incorrect standard (Rec.709) is used upon playback. What you notice is that
the lower picture is more saturated (i.e. more colorful). But also that the red is shifted a bit to yellow. [The other way
around results in a less saturated clip, red shifting towards magenta and blue
shifting to cyan.]</p>
<p>So, how do you know then, which standard to choose upon playback? Well that's
not always possible, but you have to know the origin of your file. Also, in some
cases, that information can be stored in the header of the file. You should
stick to the following guideline:</p>
<p><b>If your content is Standard Definition (SD) content use Rec.601 and if
your content is High Definition (HD) content use Rec.709, unless the header of
the content specifies otherwise.</b> I will elaborate on this in the following
sections.</p>
<a name="Should_I_correct_anything_when_processing_my_content.3F"></a>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Should I correct anything when processing my
content?</span></h2>
<p>Yes, you should correct for it in some cases. It depends on your end format
and how it is played back. In general, it is save to assume that Rec.601 is used
for Standard Definition content and Rec.709 for High Definition content upon
playback. That means that often any specific header information regarding
colorimetry will be ignored. It will be assumed here that you are processing
with AviSynth.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to encode your content as Standard Definition content (that
is, height of the encoded video &lt; 720p (720 vertical lines)). If you source
is MPEG-2 (then the colorimetry information can be stored in its header), get
the ColorMatrix plugin, and create the following script:</p>
<pre># ColorMatrix does a Rec.709 -&gt; Rec.601 conversion, if your source is Rec.709:
DGDecode_mpeg2source(&quot;D:\source.d2v&quot;, info=3)
ColorMatrix(hints=true, dest=2, interlace=false) # use interlace=true for interlaced content</pre>
<p>Suppose you want to encode your content as High Definition content (that is,
height of the encoded video &gt;= 720p). Create the following script:</p>
<pre># ColorMatrix does a Rec.601 -&gt; Rec.709 conversion, if your source is Rec.601:
DGDecode_mpeg2source(&quot;D:\source.d2v&quot;, info=3)
ColorMatrix(hints=true, dest=0, interlace=false) # use interlace=true for interlaced content</pre>
<p>If the colorimetry information is not stored in the header (as with DivX/XviD
for example), it is not really possible to tell which colorimetry is used to
create it. All that you can do is assume Rec.601 is used for SD content and
Rec.709 is used for HD content, and hope that the assumption is correct. In this
case, you can't use the <i>hints</i> parameter of ColorMatrix, but you need to
give the conversion explicitly using the <i>mode</i> parameter.</p>
<a name="How_can_I_use_the_correct_standard_upon_playback.3F"></a>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">How can I use the correct standard upon playback?</span></h2>
<p>Whether this is possible (provided that the wrong standard is used upon play
back) depends on how your content is being played back. If you use a software
player you need to check whether it has an option to correct it. If you use a
directshow based player (such as WMP or MPC) there are different possibilities
which are explained below. If the renderer does the YCbCr-&gt;RGB conversion,
you should keep in mind that (as found are out in this <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=82217&amp;page=24" class="external text" title="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=82217&amp;page=24" rel="nofollow">thread</a>):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Windowed/renderless VMR7 and VMR9 use BT.601 for video &lt; 720p (720
    vertical lines)</li>
  <li>Windowed/renderless VMR7 and VMR9 use BT.709 for video &gt;= 720p (720
    vertical lines)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are using Haali's Video Renderer (get <a href="http://haali.cs.msu.ru/mkv/" class="external text" title="http://haali.cs.msu.ru/mkv/" rel="nofollow">Haali
Media Splitter</a> in order to install it) you can choose the color standard.</p>
<p>Have a look <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=134735" class="external text" title="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=134735" rel="nofollow">here</a>
for information about the different renderers.</p>
<a name="Method_.231:_Adjusting_graphics_driver_settings"></a>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Method #1: Adjusting graphics driver settings</span></h3>
<p>I'm not sure whether this is possible. I need to ask someone ...</p>
<a name="Method_.232:_Convert_to_RGB32_with_ffdshow"></a>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Method #2: Convert to RGB32 with ffdshow</span></h3>
<p>Forcing ffdshow to output RGB32 can help prevent colorimetry issues. Downside
of this method is that doing this conversion in software increases CPU usage.</p>
<p>To force RGB32 output in ffdshow, you should uncheck all colorspaces except
RGB32 on the Output page in ffdshow configuration. It is also recommended to
enable &quot;High quality YV12 to RGB conversion&quot;. On the RGB conversion
page, you can choose which standard should be assumed, BT.601 or BT709. Choose
the first for SD material, and the latter for HD video.</p>
<a name="Method_.233:_Pixelshader_in_Media_Player_Classic"></a>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Method #3: Pixelshader in Media Player Classic</span></h3>
<p>A pixelshader is a small program that runs on your graphics card and
processes some graphic data. In this case each frame of your video.</p>
<p>Media Player Classic has a shader called &quot;BT.601 -&gt; BT.709&quot;. A
shader which does the conversion the other way around is still not available.
Use this when needed.</p>
<p>Some requirements for the pixelshaders in MPC:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You need to use a compatible video renderer: VMR-7 (renderless), VMR-9
    (renderless), or EVR Custom Presenter.</li>
  <li>Surface setting must be set to &quot;3D surfaces&quot;.</li>
  <li>It requires some DirectX components that are not included with a default
    Windows installation. Run the DirectX Web Installer to get the required
    DirectX updates.</li>
</ul>
<a name="Method_.234:_Use_AviSynth_script_in_ffdshow_video_decoder"></a>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Method #4: Use AviSynth script in ffdshow video
decoder</span></h3>
<p>There are two ways to do this. The first one is to use the ColorMatrix
plugin, as explained in one of the previous sections, and the other one is to
convert to RGB using the appropriate matrix:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../pictures/advancedtopics/ffdshow_avisynth2.jpg" width="578" height="296"></p>
<p>Here ffdshow will convert your content to RGB using Rec.601.</p>
<a name="What_do_the_specifications_say_about_which_colorimetry_is_supported_in_a_particular_format.3F"></a>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">What do the specifications say about which
colorimetry is supported in a particular format?</span></h2>
<a name="VCD.2FMPEG-1"></a>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">VCD/MPEG-1</span></h3>
<p>Part 2 of the MPEG-1 standard covers video and is defined in ISO/IEC-11172-2.
It is heavily based on H.261. The colorimetry information is not written into
the header.</p>
<a name="DVD.2FMPEG-2"></a>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">DVD/MPEG-2</span></h3>
<p>The DVD specs are not publicly available for free, and I don't know people who
have read those specs. The DVD specs should be a subset of the MPEG-2 specs (yes
I know, that's a big assumption), and the latter is available for free. It says
the following:</p>
<p><i>The older 1995 MPEG-2 spec (ISO/IEC 13818-2: 1995 (E)) says</i></p>
<p>&quot;In the case that sequence_display_extension() is not present in the
bitstream or colour_description is zero the matrix coefficients are assumed to
be those corresponding to matrix_coefficients having the value 1.&quot; The
value 1 stands for &quot;1 Recommendation ITU-R BT.709&quot;. Note that in 1995
the first DVD titles came out, so when making those specs, the DVD didn't exist
yet. In 2000, the MPEG-2 specs have changed with respect to this:</p>
<p><i>The newer <a href="http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-H.262/en" class="external text" title="http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-H.262/en" rel="nofollow">2000
MPEG-2 spec (ITU-T Rec.H262 (2000 E))</a> says</i></p>
<p>&quot;In the case that sequence_display_extension() is not present in the
bitstream or colour_description is zero the matrix coefficients are assumed to
be implicitly defined by the application.&quot; The matrix coefficients are
described in &quot;Table 6-9 – Matrix Coefficients&quot;.</p>
<p>In other words if sequence_display_extension is not present, the colorimetry
can be anything.</p>
<a name="The_ATSC_standard"></a>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">The ATSC standard</span></h3>
<p><i>Just for kicks, ATSC standard on page 18 (<a href="http://www.atsc.org/standards/a_81.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.atsc.org/standards/a_81.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.atsc.org/standards/a_81.pdf</a>
) talks about colorimetry and the assumptions to make when
'sequence_display_extension' does not tell you what to do:<br>
</i>&quot;The values for color_primaries, transfer_characteristics, and
matrix_coefficients shall be explicitly indicated in the
sequence_display_extension. While all values for color_primaries,
transfer_characteristics, and matrix_coefficients defined in Tables 6-7, 6-8,
and 6-9 of ISO/IEC 13818-2 [16, 18] are allowed in the transmitted bit stream,
it is noted that ITU-R BT.709 [27] and SMPTE 170M are the most likely to be in
common use.</p>
<p>Note: Some previously-encoded legacy material may not have the colorimetry
(i.e., color_primaries, transfer_characteristics, and matrix_coefficients)
explicitly indicated in the sequence_display_extension, in which case the
colorimetry is most likely ITU-R BT.709 for all formats except those formats
with vertical_size_value = 480, which are most likely to have colorimetry
according to SMPTE 170M.&quot;<i> As noted by [hkazemi <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=1089854#post1089854" class="external free" title="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=1089854#post1089854" rel="nofollow">http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=1089854#post1089854</a>]</i></p>

claims this table should be interpreted as follows:<br>
<i>Having finally heard back from a person who is in the professional encoder
industry (no I will not say who), I have more reliable information.: &quot;The
table is actually the limitation of what you can use. In other words if you set
the sequence_display_extension to Rec.709 for dvd it is illegal. That doesn't
mean it will not play etc it just means that it is not supported and any player
that strictly follows the specs is more likely just to ignore it as if no value
was set at all.&quot;</i></p>
